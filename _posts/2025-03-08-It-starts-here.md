This personal blog starts around the end of my PhD.

## Why
As I approach the end of my academic journey, the path to the future is as wide as it is dreadful. I no longer have a well defined "next step" nor having a destination (_as clearly as finishing the thesis by Feb 27_) that I can march toward.<br>

So I decide to write :) <br>

_Well, to be succint, I should just say "I'm lost, therefore I write"._

## What
Probably just updating my life.
